# CementCompositeStrength_PredictionModel


# Problem Statment:
[Doomain Knowledge]

# Objective:

1. To Pradict Cement Composite Strength Based on Independant Columns

# Steps to build a Machine Learning Model:


## Step 1 :

Import Basic Scikit Learn Libraries for Data Manipulation as well Data Visualization.

## Step 2 :

Data Uploding using Pandas Function

## Step 3 :

Doing Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] :-->

1. Univariate Analysis 

2. Bi variate Analysis 

## Step 4 :

Data Cleaning Preprocessing Also Feature Engineering**


## Step 5 :

1. Split Data into Independent and Dependent Column i.e X and y 

2. Using Train and Test Split To Prevent Data Lekage.


## Step 6 :

1. Model Building Using Scikit Leanr Libraries 


## Step 7 :

Save Your Best Model as Pickel File 


## Step 8 :

Deploy The Pickel File Using stremlit
